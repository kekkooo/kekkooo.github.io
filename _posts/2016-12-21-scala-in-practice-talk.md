Hello Scala enthusiasts,

Some day ago I held a 4h seminar at the University of Cagliari introducing Scala and Akka-Http to more or less 80 hungry student minds. It has been a great occasion to introduce them to such interesting technologies.

Here you can find the slides that have been used for the presentation. 

Hope you will find them as an useful introduction.
If you want to try the examples please install sbt and scala.

Cheers!
